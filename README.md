1. Seperated styles, javascript from index.html.
2. Created styles folder and created SCSS file for styles and compiled scss to css using node-sass
3. Moved script part to js/app.js file
4. We can use bootstrap for responsive, but I used media queries.
5. Added validation such that an empty task cannot be submitted.
6. Converted float-based layouts to flexbox-based layouts. The visuals did not change, just the SCSS/CSS that handles the layout.
